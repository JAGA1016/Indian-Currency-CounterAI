# Indian Currency Detection

- In this project I trained yolov8 object detection model for recognition of Indiancurrency notes.
- The primary objective was to create a computer vision solution that could accurately identify and various denominations of Indian currency notes in real-time images or video streams.
- Deployed the model in Roboflow and evaluated the model performance using real images different from dataset.
-  I used Roboflow visualization of training resluts and graphs.

- dataset contains coins and Notes images collected from the google images and some of them are manually taken pictures.


## Frameworks
- TensorFlow 
## Deployment 

I have deployed this model in the Robloflow platform.
